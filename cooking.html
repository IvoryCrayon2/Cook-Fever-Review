<H1>  Cooking Fever </H1>
<HR> 
<p2> The most long time in inducing game of all time Cooking is just another people, the game is very complicated because it has 
customers begging for food at which has to be given to them at a pace that's faster then before. So you see yourself throwing 
delicious meals at them. For example... </p2>

<p3> This is the game at which nobody should not know about its also a very humbling game at which can please the minds active, 
for people,  that think it's not just a eventful game it clearly isn't so many place a open but you can't move to the next world, without any special 
gems. This is sad because you have been given 3000xp to gain to unlock the gems clearly it's cheating. How should you continue playing? it's just 
impossible to make it, also it's just a waste of time.  </p3>
